
1. Enhanced Song Card Design
---------------------------

The goal? Make each **song card** pop with its state (like "currently playing") and show key info efficiently. The **playback indicator** is already in place and rocking!

### HTML Structure (Generated by `displayResults`)

``` html

<div class="song-card ${song.id === state.currentSongId ? 'playing' : ''}" data-id="${song.id}">
  <div class="song-thumbnail-container">
    <img class="song-thumbnail" loading="lazy" src="${song.thumbnail || '/static/images/default-cover.png'}" alt="${song.title}">
    <div class="song-duration">${formatTime(song.duration)}</div>
  </div>
  <div class="song-info">
    <div class="song-title">${song.title}</div>
    <div class="song-artist">${song.artist}</div>
  </div>
  <div class="playback-indicator">
    <div class="playback-bar"></div>
    <div class="playback-bar"></div>
    <div class="playback-bar"></div>
    <div class="playback-bar"></div>
  </div>
</div>

```

2. Enhanced UI
-------------

We’ve upgraded the **user interface** to make it slick and responsive. Here’s what’s new:

### Changes in Elements
- **Progress Bar**: Increased width for better visibility.
- **Speaker Icon**: Improved for a sharper, modern look.
- **Song Cards**: Enhanced with better spacing and visual effects.
- **Screen Customization**: Added responsive tweaks for different screen sizes (phones, tablets, desktops).

3. Backend Changes
-----------------

The backend’s been tuned for reliability and ease of use:
- **Docker**: Added auto-run system for the Redis container.
- **Robustness**: Included more fault-tolerant options for smoother performance.
